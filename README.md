# Hi, I'm Aslam Rosul 👋

I am an Information Technology student with strong interest in Backend Development and Cyber Security.

I enjoy building REST APIs, understanding authentication mechanisms, and analyzing how systems can be secured.

My experience includes working with Laravel, Next.js, database systems, and exploring web security testing using tools such as Burp Suite and ffuf.

I aim to grow as a security-oriented backend engineer who understands both system development and system protection.
